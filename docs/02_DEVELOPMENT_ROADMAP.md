# Djonik 2.0 — Development Roadmap

> **Canonical NOW source.** Do not infer current work from issue number, date or another chat. The item explicitly marked **NOW** here is authoritative.

## Goal

Build Djonik as a Claude-native conversational PM, adding one working capability at a time while avoiding custom infrastructure unless real usage demonstrates a need.

## Current state

Foundations 1–11 are accepted. `Джонік` is the authoritative Claude Managed Agent; Telegram is the thin channel adapter; `Djonik Memory` provides durable cross-session memory; `task-management`, `daily-planning`, and `weekly-planning` Skills are attached and live; `Djonik Personal` Vault supplies Trello/Google credentials; Trello MCP read/write flows work against live data; same-card verify-after-write is enforced by the thin client; dead Managed Sessions recover automatically; conversational PM, daily/weekly planning, and project/client context memory have been validated. The current focus is distinguishing suggestions from explicitly accepted plans and commitments while preserving fresh Trello as operational truth.

## Execution order

### DONE — Foundation 1: Real Djonik Managed Agent + first Console Session (#1)
Accepted 2026-09-15.

### DONE — Foundation 2: Thin repo client for the existing Djonik Managed Agent (#2)
Accepted 2026-09-15 at commit `ca7c82401059853d6fa7485d7b24c205e48829d3`.

### DONE — Foundation 3: Telegram adapter to the existing Djonik Managed Agent (#3)
Accepted 2026-09-15 at commit `43b976e16c52c8090b9e585c03141d3520e4e7a5`.

### DONE — Foundation 4: Durable Claude Memory Store across Djonik sessions (#4)

### DONE — Blocker: Session vault wiring and retryable MCP errors (#6)
Accepted 2026-09-15 at commit `ddbd3dfb117ff4da16f15598619499f686a4b53e`.

### DONE — Foundation 6: Trello read surface through Claude MCP (#7)
Accepted 2026-09-15.

### DONE — Foundation 7: Trello write surface with verified mutations (#8)
Accepted 2026-09-15 at commits `842352a0e90b143f2e5d397e92586ea4673cf696` and `5bec33a53c1e57eed2edb53ad5cceb01d3e77be6`.

Verified foundation:
- `trelloWriteCard` is the bounded enabled mutation tool;
- create/update/move work against live Trello;
- every claimed card write is backed by a same-card verification read;
- unrelated reads cannot satisfy verification;
- one bounded corrective nudge is allowed, then fail-closed.

### DONE — Foundation 8: Conversational PM validation across Telegram and Trello (#9)
Accepted 2026-09-15 at commits `f1a25bae9ad441d3dabb8ccfe6f6832cffaf7e97` and `b46824bb9a815be1d1f345e3b7503d9d63b6c727`.

Verified foundation:
- realistic Telegram scenarios A–F passed;
- referents and corrections resolve to the intended task without duplicates;
- advice-only turns cause zero mutation;
- live-state answers use fresh Trello evidence;
- ambiguity produces clarification and zero write;
- durable Memory survives a new Session while live Trello outranks remembered task state;
- dead Managed Sessions are invalidated and transparently reconnected;
- typecheck passed, tests passed 30/30, and `git diff --check` was clean.

### DONE — Foundation 9: Daily planning Skill and work-context reasoning (#10)
Accepted 2026-09-16 at commit `d95c0e85ed6287078e944c64bbe26cce01c00b9a`.

Verified foundation:
- custom `daily-planning` Skill exists in Claude workspace and is attached to the existing Djonik agent;
- canonical source is `.claude/skills/daily-planning/SKILL.md`;
- daily plans are grounded in fresh Trello reads;
- planning-only turns produce zero Trello mutation;
- explicit priorities and conversational plan corrections are handled coherently;
- capacity overload is handled by proposing a realistic subset instead of pretending everything fits;
- after live Trello state changed, a fresh read changed the updated plan, proving live state outranks prior plan/Memory;
- task-management and write-verification regressions were absent;
- typecheck passed, tests passed 30/30, and `git diff --check` was clean.

### DONE — Foundation 10: Weekly planning Skill and capacity reasoning (#11)
Accepted 2026-09-16 at commit `c7fdca193c79f127b90c979901dca23051aa5820`.

Verified foundation:
- custom `weekly-planning` Skill exists in Claude workspace and is attached alongside existing Skills;
- canonical source is `.claude/skills/weekly-planning/SKILL.md`;
- weekly plans use fresh Trello evidence and distinguish deadlines, in-progress, waiting/blocked, and backlog work;
- overload is surfaced explicitly with realistic deferrals rather than pretending everything fits;
- weekly→daily drill-down stays coherent with `daily-planning`;
- planning-only turns produce zero Trello mutation;
- live Trello changes override prior plans/Memory;
- task-management, daily-planning, and write-verification regressions were absent;
- typecheck passed, tests passed 30/30, and `git diff --check` was clean.

### DONE — Foundation 11: Project/client context memory (#12)
Accepted 2026-09-16 with no repo/config/Skill/Agent change required.

Verified foundation:
- existing Claude-native Memory behavior already handles useful durable project/client context;
- stable context survives genuinely new Managed Sessions without transcript replay;
- durable Memory and fresh Trello evidence can coexist coherently in one answer;
- corrected durable context supersedes stale context in a later Session;
- project/client facts remain correctly scoped without cross-project leakage;
- transient task/list/due state is not trusted over fresh Trello;
- existing `DJONIK_MEMORY_INSTRUCTIONS` already encode the durable-vs-live boundary;
- typecheck passed, tests passed 30/30, and `git diff --check` was clean.

### NOW — Foundation 12: Accepted plans and commitments (#13)

Goal:

`planning conversation → user explicitly accepts/commits → durable accepted-plan/commitment context → later PM reasoning uses it appropriately → fresh Trello still owns current operational truth`

Scope:
- distinguish advice/suggestions from explicit plan acceptance and real commitments;
- validate that unaccepted proposals are not remembered as commitments;
- preserve explicitly accepted plans across new Sessions when useful;
- preserve explicit user commitments across new Sessions;
- allow corrections/cancellations to supersede stale commitment context;
- distinguish `what we agreed` from `what Trello says now`;
- use existing Claude Memory first and add no parallel commitments database/state mirror unless real validation proves a need;
- preserve existing Skills, Telegram, Memory behavior, Trello permissions and same-card write verification.

Acceptance evidence:
- unaccepted suggestions are not treated as commitments;
- explicit accepted plans/commitments survive a genuinely new Session;
- corrections/cancellations supersede stale accepted context;
- accepted/history context can coexist with fresh Trello live state in one answer;
- no unnecessary new architecture is introduced.

## Capability waves after the foundation

### Wave A — Planning and work context
- daily planning Skill;
- weekly planning Skill;
- workload/capacity reasoning;
- richer project/client memory;
- accepted plans and commitments where genuinely useful.

### Wave B — Studio intake
- screenshots/images;
- PDFs/files;
- grouped related Telegram messages;
- structured task/checklist generation;
- source-preserving context.

### Wave C — Project health and reviews
- project-health Skill;
- evidence-based work review;
- stale/blocked/risk judgement;
- meaningful follow-up lifecycle.

### Wave D — Proactive PM
- scheduled morning/weekly agent turns;
- reminder/follow-up triggers;
- silent-by-default exception monitoring;
- Telegram delivery only when useful.

### Wave E — Calendar and wider integrations
- Google Calendar awareness;
- calendar-informed planning;
- bounded event management;
- selected additional integrations only when they improve the PM loop.

### Wave F — Specialist agents if justified
Potential specialists:
- studio intake analyst;
- research/context agent;
- weekly review analyst.

Do not introduce them because multi-agent is available. Require measured value.

## Architecture guardrails

During all phases:
- the Claude Managed Agent resource is the authoritative Djonik runtime;
- Claude reasoning stays primary;
- do not rebuild a custom Messages tool loop;
- do not create a duplicate local Djonik agent when Console/Managed Agents owns the configuration;
- Claude Memory Stores are the default durable memory mechanism;
- do not create a custom DB/memory system without measured evidence;
- Skills contain reusable expertise/workflows, not mutable project data;
- do not turn adapter code into a phrase/intent router;
- keep external live state fresh through tools;
- verify mutations;
- prefer bounded vertical slices over broad scaffolding.
