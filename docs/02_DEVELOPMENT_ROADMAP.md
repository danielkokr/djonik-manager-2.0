# Djonik 2.0 — Development Roadmap

> **Canonical NOW source.** Do not infer current work from issue number, date or another chat. The item explicitly marked **NOW** here is authoritative.

## Goal

Build Djonik as a Claude-native conversational PM, adding one working capability at a time while avoiding custom infrastructure unless real usage demonstrates a need.

## Current state

Foundations 1–9 are accepted. `Джонік` is the authoritative Claude Managed Agent; Telegram is the thin channel adapter; `Djonik Memory` provides durable cross-session memory; `task-management` and `daily-planning` Skills are attached and live; `Djonik Personal` Vault supplies Trello/Google credentials; Trello MCP read/write flows work against live data; same-card verify-after-write is enforced by the thin client; dead Managed Sessions recover automatically; realistic multi-turn PM behavior and daily planning have been validated. The current focus is the next Wave A capability: weekly planning and capacity reasoning.

## Execution order

### DONE — Foundation 1: Real Djonik Managed Agent + first Console Session (#1)
Accepted 2026-09-15.

### DONE — Foundation 2: Thin repo client for the existing Djonik Managed Agent (#2)
Accepted 2026-09-15 at commit `ca7c82401059853d6fa7485d7b24c205e48829d3`.

### DONE — Foundation 3: Telegram adapter to the existing Djonik Managed Agent (#3)
Accepted 2026-09-15 at commit `43b976e16c52c8090b9e585c03141d3520e4e7a5`.

### DONE — Foundation 4: Durable Claude Memory Store across Djonik sessions (#4)
Accepted 2026-09-15 at commit `8617e691c0e791ce5efe6c80876383491f915ec0`.

### DONE — Foundation 5: First custom Skill — task-management (#5)
Accepted 2026-09-15 at commit `478cd60c604392fdce3ae3b56624fa7c6299f7df`.

### DONE — Blocker: Session vault wiring and retryable MCP errors (#6)
Accepted 2026-09-15 at commit `ddbd3dfb117ff4da16f15598619499f686a4b53e`.

### DONE — Foundation 6: Trello read surface through Claude MCP (#7)
Accepted 2026-09-15.

### DONE — Foundation 7: Trello write surface with verified mutations (#8)
Accepted 2026-09-15 at commits `842352a0e90b143f2e5d397e92586ea4673cf696` and `5bec33a53c1e57eed2edb53ad5cceb01d3e77be6`.

Verified foundation:
- `trelloWriteCard` is the bounded enabled mutation tool;
- create/update/move work against live Trello;
- every claimed card write is backed by a same-card verification read;
- unrelated reads cannot satisfy verification;
- one bounded corrective nudge is allowed, then fail-closed.

### DONE — Foundation 8: Conversational PM validation across Telegram and Trello (#9)
Accepted 2026-09-15 at commits `f1a25bae9ad441d3dabb8ccfe6f6832cffaf7e97` and `b46824bb9a815be1d1f345e3b7503d9d63b6c727`.

Verified foundation:
- realistic Telegram scenarios A–F passed;
- referents and corrections resolve to the intended task without duplicates;
- advice-only turns cause zero mutation;
- live-state answers use fresh Trello evidence;
- ambiguity produces clarification and zero write;
- durable Memory survives a new Session while live Trello outranks remembered task state;
- dead Managed Sessions are invalidated and transparently reconnected;
- typecheck passed, tests passed 30/30, and `git diff --check` was clean.

### DONE — Foundation 9: Daily planning Skill and work-context reasoning (#10)
Accepted 2026-09-16 at commit `d95c0e85ed6287078e944c64bbe26cce01c00b9a`.

Verified foundation:
- custom `daily-planning` Skill exists in Claude workspace and is attached to the existing Djonik agent;
- canonical source is `.claude/skills/daily-planning/SKILL.md`;
- daily plans are grounded in fresh Trello reads;
- planning-only turns produce zero Trello mutation;
- explicit priorities and conversational plan corrections are handled coherently;
- capacity overload is handled by proposing a realistic subset instead of pretending everything fits;
- after live Trello state changed, a fresh read changed the updated plan, proving live state outranks prior plan/Memory;
- task-management and write-verification regressions were absent;
- typecheck passed, tests passed 30/30, and `git diff --check` was clean.

### NOW — Foundation 10: Weekly planning Skill and capacity reasoning (#11)

Goal:

`"що мені робити цього тижня?" → fresh Trello evidence + durable preferences/context → realistic weekly priorities + day-level distribution → optional explicit mutations only when requested`

Scope:
- create one custom `weekly-planning` Skill;
- use fresh Trello state as source of truth for current work;
- distinguish deadlines, in-progress work, waiting/blocked work, backlog and explicit priorities;
- reason about realistic weekly capacity without inventing unsupported precision;
- distribute work across days rather than returning only a flat priority list;
- surface overload, conflicts, stale work and missing decisions;
- keep weekly planning coherent with the existing daily-planning Skill;
- preserve planning/advice as read-only unless the user explicitly asks for live task mutation;
- validate through real Telegram conversation.

Acceptance evidence:
- Skill exists in Claude workspace and is attached alongside current Skills;
- weekly plans use fresh Trello evidence;
- workload/capacity judgement is realistic and explicit about uncertainty;
- weekly→daily drill-down stays coherent;
- planning-only turns produce zero mutation;
- fresh live state outranks earlier plans and Memory;
- no unnecessary new architecture is introduced.

## Capability waves after the foundation

### Wave A — Planning and work context
- daily planning Skill;
- weekly planning Skill;
- workload/capacity reasoning;
- richer project/client memory;
- accepted plans and commitments where genuinely useful.

### Wave B — Studio intake
- screenshots/images;
- PDFs/files;
- grouped related Telegram messages;
- structured task/checklist generation;
- source-preserving context.

### Wave C — Project health and reviews
- project-health Skill;
- evidence-based work review;
- stale/blocked/risk judgement;
- meaningful follow-up lifecycle.

### Wave D — Proactive PM
- scheduled morning/weekly agent turns;
- reminder/follow-up triggers;
- silent-by-default exception monitoring;
- Telegram delivery only when useful.

### Wave E — Calendar and wider integrations
- Google Calendar awareness;
- calendar-informed planning;
- bounded event management;
- selected additional integrations only when they improve the PM loop.

### Wave F — Specialist agents if justified
Potential specialists:
- studio intake analyst;
- research/context agent;
- weekly review analyst.

Do not introduce them because multi-agent is available. Require measured value.

## Architecture guardrails

During all phases:
- the Claude Managed Agent resource is the authoritative Djonik runtime;
- Claude reasoning stays primary;
- do not rebuild a custom Messages tool loop;
- do not create a duplicate local Djonik agent when Console/Managed Agents owns the configuration;
- Claude Memory Stores are the default durable memory mechanism;
- do not create a custom DB/memory system without measured evidence;
- Skills contain reusable expertise/workflows, not mutable project data;
- do not turn adapter code into a phrase/intent router;
- keep external live state fresh through tools;
- verify mutations;
- prefer bounded vertical slices over broad scaffolding.

## Legacy repo

`danielkokr/djonik-manager` may be consulted for product lessons, test scenarios and failure modes.

Do not treat its architecture or open backlog as the roadmap for Djonik 2.0.
